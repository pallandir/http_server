## About The Project

Network programming is not something that is often tech and sometimes not understanding how data is sent through systems and networks can be difficult if we don't know about the protocols, their behaviour and so on. The goal of this project is to create a simple server in python that would allow file sharing accross a same network in order for example to allow a teacher to share resources with its students.

## Definition of Done

This project will be considered as done once the following requirements are fullfilled.

- A server and a client can listen to each other and share data.
- Data can be shared from the same network to any devices trying to connect (laptop, phone, desktop).
- DOS control is implemented in order to prevent a specific machine to attempt multiple connexion in a small period of time.
